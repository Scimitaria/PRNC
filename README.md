# PRNC
### A Polish Reverse Notation calculator, written in Forth.

I would've done something more complicated, but Forth is the most obnoxiously incomprehensible language I've encountered so far, 
and a PRNC seems tailored to Forth's postfix stack-oriented nature.

The run script simplifies the process of running the calculator.
